## Objectives in Backtesting an Investment Strategy

1. **Understanding Risk-Return Trade-Off**: The main objective of backtesting is to understand the risk-return trade-off of an investment strategy by approximating the real-life investment process.

2. **Specifying Investment Hypothesis and Goals**: Backtesting involves specifying the investment hypothesis and goals to ensure alignment with the overall investment strategy.

3. **Determining Rules and Processes**: It is crucial to determine the rules and processes behind an investment strategy to ensure consistency and objectivity in the backtesting process.

4. **Forming Investment Portfolio**: Backtesting involves forming an investment portfolio according to the specified rules and processes to evaluate its performance.

5. **Rebalancing Portfolio**: Periodically rebalancing the portfolio is essential in backtesting to simulate real-world investment practices and assess the impact of changes over time.

6. **Computing Performance and Risk Profiles**: Calculating the performance and risk profiles of the investment strategy helps in evaluating its effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement.

7. **Rolling Window Framework**: Utilizing a rolling window framework in backtesting allows for continuous evaluation and adjustment of the investment strategy based on new data.

8. **Risk Parity**: Implementing risk parity in portfolio construction helps in ensuring that each factor or asset contributes equally to the overall risk of the portfolio.

9. **Behavioral Issues**: Being aware of behavioral issues such as survivorship bias and look-ahead bias is crucial in conducting accurate and reliable backtesting.

10. **Assessing Results**: In addition to traditional performance measurements, analysts need to consider factors such as data coverage, return distribution, factor efficacy, turnover, and decay when assessing backtesting results.

11. **Scenario Analysis and Simulation**: Supplementing backtesting with scenario analysis and simulation techniques helps in understanding the performance of an investment strategy under different market conditions and structural regimes.

12. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Conducting sensitivity analysis allows investors to explore how changes in input variables affect the target variable and risk profiles, providing a deeper understanding of the limitations of conventional simulation techniques.

By focusing on these objectives, investors can conduct thorough and insightful backtesting of their investment strategies to make informed decisions and optimize their portfolio performance.
