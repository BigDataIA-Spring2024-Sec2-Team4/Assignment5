## Steps and Procedures in Backtesting an Investment Strategy

### Rolling Window Backtesting:
1. **Specify Investment Hypothesis and Goals**: Define the objectives and expectations of the investment strategy.
2. **Determine Rules and Processes**: Establish the rules and processes behind the strategy, including factors, signals, and portfolio construction.
3. **Form Investment Portfolio**: Construct a portfolio based on the defined rules and processes.
4. **Rebalance Portfolio**: Periodically adjust the portfolio to maintain alignment with the strategy.
5. **Compute Performance and Risk Profiles**: Evaluate the performance and risk characteristics of the strategy over time.

### Rolling Window Backtesting Methodology:
- Utilizes a rolling window framework to fit/calibrate factors or trade signals.
- Rebalances the portfolio periodically based on the rolling window.
- Tracks the performance of the strategy over time.

### Common Approaches in Backtesting:
1. **Long/Short Hedged Portfolio**: A strategy that involves taking both long and short positions to hedge against market risk.
2. **Spearman Rank IC**: Uses Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to assess the relationship between variables.

### Assessing Backtesting Results:
- Consider traditional performance metrics like Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown.
- Evaluate data coverage, return distribution, factor efficacy, turnover, and decay.

### Behavioral Issues in Backtesting:
- **Survivorship Bias**: Overestimating the performance of a strategy due to excluding failed assets.
- **Look-Ahead Bias**: Using information in the backtesting process that would not have been available at the time.

### Risk Parity:
- A portfolio construction technique that aims for each asset to contribute equally to the overall risk.
- Considers volatility and correlations between assets.

### Asset Return Characteristics:
- Often negatively skewed with fat tails and tail dependence.
- Standard backtesting may not fully capture downside risk.

### Scenario Analysis and Simulation:
- Helps understand strategy performance in different structural regimes.
- Historical simulation and Monte Carlo simulation are common techniques.

### Monte Carlo Simulation:
- Involves choosing a statistical distribution for decision variables.
- Uses the inverse transformation method to simulate random variables.

### Sensitivity Analysis:
- Explores how changes in input variables affect target variables and risk profiles.
- Helps understand limitations of conventional Monte Carlo simulation.

In summary, backtesting involves a series of steps to test an investment strategy, with considerations for risk, performance, and behavioral biases. Various techniques like scenario analysis, simulation, and sensitivity analysis can enhance the backtesting process and provide a more comprehensive understanding of strategy performance.
