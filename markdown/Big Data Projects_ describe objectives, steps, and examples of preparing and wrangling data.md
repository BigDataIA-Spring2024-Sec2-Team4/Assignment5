### Data Preparation and Wrangling Overview

**Objectives:**
The main objectives of data preparation and wrangling are to ensure that the data is clean, organized, and in a format that is suitable for analysis. This process involves resolving errors, inconsistencies, and duplications in the data, as well as transforming the data into a structured format that can be used for machine learning model training.

**Steps:**
1. **Data Cleansing:**
   - Resolve incompleteness errors
   - Address invalidity errors
   - Fix inaccuracy errors
   - Resolve inconsistency errors
   - Handle non-uniformity errors
   - Remove duplication errors

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Extraction: Extract relevant information from the data
   - Aggregation: Combine data from multiple sources
   - Filtration: Filter out irrelevant data
   - Selection: Select relevant features for analysis
   - Conversion: Convert data into a suitable format for analysis

**Examples:**
- **Structured Data:**
  - *Data Cleansing:* Removing duplicate entries in a customer database
  - *Data Preprocessing:* Extracting customer purchase history for analysis

- **Text (Unstructured) Data:**
  - *Text Cleansing:* Removing HTML tags from customer reviews
  - *Text Preprocessing:* Normalizing text by lowercasing and removing stop words

By following these steps, data can be prepared and wrangled effectively for analysis and model training in various applications, including fintech and investment management.
