## Detailed Summary of the Topic:

In this reading, we discussed the importance of backtesting in the investment industry to understand the risk-return trade-off of investment strategies. The basic steps in rolling window backtesting include specifying the investment hypothesis, forming an investment portfolio, rebalancing periodically, and computing performance and risk profiles. Two commonly used approaches in backtesting are long/short hedged portfolio and Spearman rank IC.

Risk parity is a popular portfolio construction technique that considers the volatility and correlations of assets. Asset returns often exhibit negative skewness and fat tails, making standard backtesting insufficient to capture downside risk. Scenario analysis and historical simulation help understand performance in different regimes. Monte Carlo simulation is more sophisticated, with sensitivity analysis exploring how changes in input variables affect target variables and risk profiles.

## Demonstration of Sensitivity Analysis:

Sensitivity analysis is crucial in understanding the impact of changes in input variables on target variables and risk profiles. Let's consider a hypothetical investment strategy where the target variable is the annual return of a portfolio, and the input variables are interest rates, inflation rates, and GDP growth rates.

We can perform sensitivity analysis by varying each input variable individually and observing the corresponding changes in the annual return of the portfolio. For example:
- If interest rates increase by 1%, how does the annual return change?
- If inflation rates decrease by 0.5%, what is the impact on the annual return?
- If GDP growth rates remain constant, how sensitive is the annual return to changes in interest rates and inflation rates?

By conducting sensitivity analysis, investors can gain insights into the robustness of their investment strategy and understand how different factors influence the overall performance and risk profiles.
