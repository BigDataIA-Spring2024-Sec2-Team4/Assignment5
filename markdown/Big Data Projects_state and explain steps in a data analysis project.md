### Steps in a Data Analysis Project

1. **Problem Formulation**: Define the problem to be solved and the goals to be achieved.
   
2. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data from various sources, ensuring data quality and integrity.
   
3. **Data Preparation and Wrangling**:
   - For structured data: Cleanse and preprocess data to resolve errors and inconsistencies.
   - For text data: Cleanse and preprocess text by removing unwanted elements and normalizing text.
   
4. **Data Exploration**:
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and feature engineering.
   - Use visualization tools like histograms, box plots, scatterplots, and word clouds for insights.
   
5. **Model Training**:
   - Select appropriate methods based on data type and size.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, ROC curves, and AUC.
   - Tune the model to balance bias and variance errors for optimal performance.

### Text-Specific Steps in Data Analysis

1. **Text Problem Formulation**: Define the text analysis problem and objectives.
   
2. **Text Curation**: Collect and curate text data from relevant sources.
   
3. **Text Preparation and Wrangling**:
   - Cleanse text by removing html tags, punctuations, numbers, and white spaces.
   - Preprocess text by lowercasing, removing stop words, stemming, lemmatization, and creating BOW and n-grams.
   
4. **Text Exploration**:
   - Use word clouds and text-specific visualization tools for understanding text composition.
   - Apply feature selection methods like term frequency, document frequency, chi-square test, and mutual information measure.
   - Engineer features by converting numbers into tokens, creating n-grams, and using name entity recognition and parts of speech.

These steps are crucial for building effective machine learning models for both structured and unstructured data in data analysis projects.
